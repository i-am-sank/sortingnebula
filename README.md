## logic

**counting sort** ->the main logic behind this type of sort is counting the frequency of elements and the summing it to get the sorted index of elements.

**quick sort** ->the logic behind this is the pivot(median) ,the element whose left elements are smaller and right elements are greater,then partition the array and do the same with partitioned arrays.

**heap sort**-> the logic is to make a heap min or max , to get lowest or highest element of array then  separate this element and do the same with remaining array.
